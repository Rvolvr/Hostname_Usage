.Synopsis
This script will remove the registries and folders of a user on a remote computer.

.Description
This is generally to be used when a user will not be on a specific machine any more, or is taking up too much space. 

.Notes
There is no way to recreate the deleted information. 
If there are any "disconnected" sessions: those will not be identified.
